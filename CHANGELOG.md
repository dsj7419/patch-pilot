# Changelog

All notable changes to the PatchPilot extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.0] - 2025-05-04

### Added

- **Automatic Hunk Header Correction:** Implemented a new service (`HunkCorrectorService`) that automatically detects and corrects inaccurate line counts (`oldLines`, `newLines`) in hunk headers (`@@ ... @@`). This significantly improves the reliability of applying patches, especially those generated by AI assistants which often have incorrect header metadata.
- Added configuration setting `patchPilot.autoCorrectHunkHeaders` (default: `true`) to control this feature.
- Added visual indicator (`ℹ️` with tooltip) in the Patch Preview UI for files where hunk headers were automatically corrected.
- Added detailed logging to the "PatchPilot" output channel when hunk header corrections occur.
- Added telemetry events (`hunk_correction_applied`, `hunk_correction_skipped_disabled`) to track feature usage and effectiveness.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-04-26

### Added 0.2

- **Custom Branch Names:** Added ability to provide an optional custom name when using the `PatchPilot: Create Branch for Patch` command via the Command Palette. A prompt now appears allowing users to input a name or accept the default timestamped name. (Addresses Issue/Feature Request from Test 10 feedback).
- **Improved Git Error Handling:** Specific detection and user-friendly error message for Git's "dubious ownership" error, guiding the user on how to resolve it using `git config --global --add safe.directory`. (Addresses Issue/Feature Request from Test 9 feedback).
- Telemetry tracking for custom branch name usage and Git errors.

### Fixed 0.2

- **Apply Button State:** Fixed issue where the "Apply Patch" button in the webview remained enabled even when the preview showed all target files were missing. The button is now correctly disabled in this scenario. (Fixes Test 12 bug).
- *(Partial)* Improved filename handling for diffs with unusual characters or line endings in headers, resolving most Test 4 scenarios. *(Note: A known issue might persist specifically with CRLF on headers).*

### Removed 0.2

- Removed the "Create Branch" button and input field from the webview UI. Branch creation is now handled exclusively via the Command Palette (`PatchPilot: Create Branch for Patch`) for a cleaner UI and more consistent workflow.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-04-18 *(Assumed Initial Release Date)*

### Added 0.1

- Initial release of PatchPilot.
- Webview panel for pasting unified diffs (`PatchPilot: Paste Diff` command & `Ctrl+Alt+P` shortcut).
- Core multi-file patch parsing and application logic.
- Three-tier fuzzy matching system (Strict, Shifted Header, Greedy strategies).
- Configurable `patchPilot.fuzzFactor` setting.
- Automatic normalization for common AI diff issues (missing leading spaces on context lines, mixed line endings, missing `diff --git` headers).
- Interactive diff preview before applying patches.
- Basic Git integration: `patchPilot.autoStage` setting for automatic staging.
- Programmatic API commands: `patchPilot.applyPatch`, `patchPilot.parsePatch`.
- Context menu command `PatchPilot: Apply Selected Diff` for applying diff text selected in an editor.
- Basic anonymous telemetry (opt-out via `patchPilot.enableTelemetry`).
